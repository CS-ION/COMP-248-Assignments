 *                        PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 *                        
 * The following Java program prompts the user to enter a sentence which ends with a 
 * punctuation mark which is not considered part of the word. The program then processes 
 * the input and outputs the displays the length of each word, the number of words in 
 * the sentence, the length of the shortest and longest words and the average length 
 * of the words. A word is any sequence of non-white characters. For example, Iâ€™ll is 
 * 1 word, but I will is considered 2 words.
 * 
 * The program terminates by displaying a farewell message.
 *                        
 * Note - "\n" is used in most output messages in order to go to the next line 
 * to make the code more neat and human friendly.

		/* The above for loop is used to traverse through each character of the sentence entered by the user. The If statement inside
		 * the for loop checks if the character is a white-space (' ') or is the last character of the sentence (a punctuation mark).
		 * If it is neither of those, it will increment sum and tempSum until a white-space or last punctuation character is encountered.
		 * "sum" variable is used to track the total number of word which will help us in finding the average word length. "tempSum" 
		 * variable is used to track the length of each word and is set to 0 when a white-space or last punctuation character is encountered. 
		 * "count" variable is used to keep the track of the number of words and is incremented when a white-space or last punctuation 
		 * character is encountered. "largest" and "smallest" are initially set to 0 value. Whenever a white-space or last punctuation 
		 * character is encountered, the "largest" and "smallest" are compared with the tempSum to find out the longest word and the shortest
		 * word. When count is 0, meaning "tempSum" contains the length of the first word, "smallest" is assigned the current "tempSum" value 
		 * to provide a reference value when comparing further words to find out the shortest word.
