 *                        PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 *                        
 * The following Java program prompts the user to enter a sequence of courses with 
 * its grade in the format of “Course1|Grade1;Course2|Grade2;Course3|Grade3;” as 
 * one string.The program separates the string into the course name and grade 
 * individually and save the course names and grades in two different arrays 
 * (2D-character array for course names and integer array for grade). 
 * 
 * The program then outputs the courses taken and the numerical average of all 
 * courses along with the letter grade associated. The letter grade is calculates 
 * as follows -:
 * 
 *      Average           Grade
 *       >= 88             "A"                                    
 *		 >= 80             "B"
 *		 >= 67             "C"
 *		 >= 60             "D"
 *		  < 60             "F"
 * 
 * The program uses Integer.parseInt() to convert a string to an integer number and 
 * toCharArray() to convert a string to a character array. If the user enters 0, 
 * the program terminates by displaying no courses are taken as of now.
 * 
 * The program terminates by displaying a farewell message.
 *                        
 * Note - "\n" is used in most output messages in order to go to the next line 
 * to make the code more neat and human friendly.
