 *                        PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 *                        
 * A Learning Function is an empirical formula which is responsible for regulating the 
 * training of an agent with respect to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence(AI). 
 * In this regard, given below is our prototype Learning Function, ùëç, which tunes and 
 * regulates the training as well as learning in our AI agents. This is defined such that: 
 * ùëç= ùë¶ ‚àó Œ© ,given that Œ© = 0.567143 and ùë¶ is a dynamic variable, which is defined with 
 * respect to the day of the week (Mon-Sun) and the time of the day (Day-Light/Night-Time).
 * 
 * The program prompts the user to enter the Weekday and the Time as a single input 
 * separated via the space character => MoNdAy NiGHT-TiMe, Sunday Day-Light, etc.
 * If an invalid input was received; the program displays the respective error message, 
 * and terminates with a note to the user to retry again.
 * 
 * The program then processes the user‚Äôs inputs to determine the corresponding value for 
 * variable, ùë¶. Thereafter, the program computes and outputsthe resultant value for our 
 * prototype learning function, ùëç, using the aforementioned empirical formula - ùëç= ùë¶ ‚àó Œ©.
 * 
 * The program terminates by displaying a farewell message.
 *                        
 * Note - "\n" is used in most output messages in order to go to the next line 
 * to make the code more neat and human friendly.
